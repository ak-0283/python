## 📘 What I’ve Learned

### 🐍 Python Basics

* ✏️ Variables & Data Types
* 🔁 Loops & Conditionals
* 🧮 Functions & Modules
* 📁 File Handling
* 🛑 Exception Handling

### 🔢 NumPy Essentials

* 📐 Creating Arrays
* 🔍 Indexing & Slicing
* ➕ Arithmetic & Vectorized Operations
* 🚀 Broadcasting
* 🧮 Aggregations & Stats
* 📊 Multidimensional Arrays

### 🎨 Frontend with Streamlit

* ⚡ Learned from **Chai aur Code** tutorials
* 🖥️ Build interactive Python apps easily
* ▶️ Run apps with:

  ```bash
  streamlit run filename.py
  ```
* ⚙️ Setup steps:

  1. Create a virtual environment

     ```bash
     python -m venv .venv
     ```
  2. Activate it (Windows PowerShell)

     ```bash
     .venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
  3. Install Streamlit

     ```bash
