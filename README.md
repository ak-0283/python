# 🐍 Python & 🔢 NumPy Learning Journey

Welcome to my learning repository where I document everything I’ve studied about **Python**, **NumPy**, and now **Streamlit** via 📺 YouTube tutorials!

---

## 📘 What I’ve Learned

### 🐍 Python Basics
* ✏️ Variables & Data Types  
* 🔁 Loops & Conditionals  
* 🧮 Functions & Modules  
* 📁 File Handling  
* 🛑 Exception Handling  

### 🔢 NumPy Essentials
* 📐 Creating Arrays  
* 🔍 Indexing & Slicing  
* 📊 Multidimensional Arrays  

### 🎨 Frontend with Streamlit
* ⚡ Learned from **Chai aur Code** tutorials  
* 🖥️ Build interactive Python apps easily  
* ▶️ Run apps with:
  ```bash
  streamlit run filename.py
  ```

* ⚙️ Setup steps:

  1. Create a virtual environment

     ```bash
     python -m venv .venv
     ```
  2. Activate it (Windows PowerShell)

     ```bash
     .venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
  3. Install Streamlit

     ```bash
     pip install streamlit
     ```
  4. Create your first Streamlit app 🚀
